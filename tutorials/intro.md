HGCAL DB is DB .....


These tutorials grew from me working on the DB as a grad student and member of the CMS experiment, and wanting to gather all these things in one place. 

Although there are many tutorials and presentations by Aivaras, Florian, etc. and other twikis, there is yet to be a single place to bring explain all these tools and how to *practically* use them in one single place.

Many of the technologies explained in the next chapters were briefly explained in the GEM database paper, but there has been many changes since then, and introductions of new technologies, and a complete overhaul of the central XML database.

It's important that we are familiar with the motivations of HGCAL, and the basics of all of its components and how they work and the procedures for testing the components.


I think such a resource is important if we were 
to make this DB (and CMS databases in general) better, and involve more people and ideas into their development, and to have this information readily available, but separate from the official documentation of each of the covered tools.

# HGCAL Introduction

One of the best resources to learn about HGCAL in general (based on my limited, silicon-sensor-biased  knowledge) is [Victoria's thesis](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2766455/files/CERN-THESIS-2021-045.pdf)

and [Elias Pree](https://inspirehep.net/files/65495e3bb489420d4e59189883319e30)'s thesis.
